    description:
      'The Canon EOS 250D is an ultra-compact digital SLR that features a 24MP APS-C-sized CMOS sensor, DIGIC 8 processor and Dual Pixel autofocus system. The main differences between the SL3 and SL2 is the addition of Eye AF during live view, an even smaller and lighter body, and 4K video. While its Dual Pixel AF system promises very good live view and video performance, the through-the-viewfinder AF system is aging. This camera has a fully articulating 3" touchscreen display with an easy-to-use interface, 1080/60p video capture and a burst rate of up to 5 fps. The SL3 can capture 4K video but with a substantial crop and no Dual Pixel AF. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi (with NFC) and Bluetooth. A versatile standard zoom for Canon APS-C-format DSLRs, the EF-S 18-55mm f/4- 5.6 IS STM Lens is a sleek and flexible option for everyday shooting. Spanning a 28.8 -88mm equivalent focal length range, this lens covers wide-angle to portrait-length perspectives, and features an Optical Image Stabilizer to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to four stops for sharper handheld shooting. One aspherical element is featured in the optical design to improve sharpness and resolution by minimizing spherical aberrations and distortion, and a Super Spectra coating has also been applied to suppress flare and ghosting.',
